# 🎮 Test Games

A collection of small game projects written in **Python** — built to practice and improve my programming skills.

---

## 🧩 Overview
This repository includes several **simple Python games**, each designed as a standalone mini-project.
They focus on **logic, structure, and interactivity**, helping me learn step by step through hands-on coding.

## 🚀 Games Included
Each folder represents a separate game project:

- 🎲 **guessing game:** *guessing_game.py* — a game where the user has to guess a hidden number within the given attempts
- 🕹️ **random math game:** *random_math_Q.py* — a simple program that generates random math problems and keeps track of your time it took the user to get it done
- 🧠 **rock paper sissor:** *rps.py* — a simple rock paper sissor game 
- 🎲 **turtle race:** *turtle_race.py* — a simple program that creates a certain number of digital turtles to race across the given window
